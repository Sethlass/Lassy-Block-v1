# Lassy Block

## Overview
**Lassy Block** is the third game in my ambitious quest to recreate some of the first games ever madeâ€”all in just 10 days. Lassy Block is a modern take on the classic game of Tetris, built using Java. The game features custom graphics, sound, and user-friendly instructions to provide a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience.

## How to Play
- **Up Arrow:** Rotate the falling piece
- **Left Arrow:** Move the piece left
- **Right Arrow:** Move the piece right
- **Down Arrow:** Drop the piece one step
- **Spacebar:** Drop the piece quickly

The objective is to fit the falling blocks together to complete full rows, which will then be cleared from the game board. The game continues until there is no more room for new pieces.

## Features
- **Custom Soundtrack:** Background music that plays during the game.
- **Smooth Controls:** Responsive controls for moving and rotating pieces.
- **User Interface:** A scoreboard, game title, and instructions are all displayed on the screen.
- **Game Over Screen:** The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the board.
